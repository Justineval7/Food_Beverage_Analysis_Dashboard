# Food_Beverage_Analysis_Dashboard

In this project, I created food and Beverages sales analysis Dashborad using PowerBI to answer some business questions.

After the acquisition of dataset, the data was properly cleaned and transformed using Power Query

Data modelling was properly done to connect the different tables.

DAX functions were used to generate the calculted columns and measures.

The next is the represesnation of the key findings on a Dashboard using appropritae chats to convey the insights.
